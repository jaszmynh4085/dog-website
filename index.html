            <h2>More on sizes:</h2>
            <br> *All sizes depends on who you ask.*
            <br>*Some places have medium/large dogs starting at 55 pounds others at 50 pounds and small/medium at 25-35 pounds*
            <div class="jumbotron">


                <br>
                <p>For a dog to be considered a large dog breed they have to weigh at least 50 pounds and have a height of (around) 24 inches. From there breeders separate the dogs further. Dogs over 100 pounds will be considered giant dogs. Officially any
                    dog that weighs more than 50 pounds but less than 100 are large dogs </p>

                <br>
                <p>Small to Medium sized dogs are about 18-22 inches in height and weigh about 35-65 (or 40-60) pounds </p>

                <br>
                <p>Small dog breeds may be around 10 inches. Then there are miniature dog breeds such as toy dogs that vary between 4 pounds and 12 pounds and teacup dogs that are smaller than usual toy dogs</p>
